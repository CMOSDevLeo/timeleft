# timeleft
Tool build while procrastinating and because I wanted to know how to execute a python file from anywhere without having to type .py

The Program gives you the time which it takes to view the remaining video considering a speed multiplier

Created symbolic link for not having to type .py after timeleft with:
sudo ln -s /path/to/your/script.py /usr/local/bin/script
